# stacksProject
Create a project that practices queues and stacks. Look at the projects in Fig 10.11, the Chipotles Queue project, and Figures 10.13 a, b, and c, the Driveway Parking program, as references. from Introduction to Programming with Java A Problem Solving Approach, Second Edition by John Dean and Raymond Dean

Instructions for the code to create and work with a queue:  

Create a queue 
Add 3 names to it 
Print the queue 
Remove a name and print it 
Print the queue Add another name 
Print the queue In a loop, until the queue is empty, remove a name and print it. 

Then repeat the same code, in the same project, to create and work with a stack


== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project.  We have an
[open {bug ticket, mailing list thread, etc.} ](INSERT_LINK) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
[check this resource](INSERT_LINK) for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
